Dark Souls has autisms! He's prone to making inpromptu speeches and rambling about stuff that is kind of unhelpful. He's objectively a bad speaker but people are drawn to his pure, kind of focused-on-what-doesn't-matter heart. Or they just think he's funny.

He likes history in general, but his special interest is military history (what lead him to choose knighthood in the first place, really) and he loves researching war leaders, tactics, and epic fights.

While he does try to hide it, Dark Souls is of noble descent. 

Marçon II de Domine. The eighth child of the Vicomte Maxence de Domine; he knew he wouldn't inherit too much, so set out to find his own path and honour. Originally trained as a knight but a passing paladin sensed his potential and mentored him.

Now a devout follower of Pelor, Marçon took on the alias Dark Souls as a proud title to "reclaim the word 'dark' from villains". He vows to root out evil wherever it may lay.
