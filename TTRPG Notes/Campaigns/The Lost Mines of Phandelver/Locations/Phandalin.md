In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin.
- home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains
- the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off
- A gang known as the [[Redbrands]] has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town
- gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as [[Glasstaff]]

>The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of ==forty or fifty simple log buildings==, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More ==old ruins==—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a ==much larger town in centuries past==. Most of the newer buildings are ==set on the sides of the cart track==, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.

>As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.

> [!todo]+ OPTIONAL: [[Sildar Hallwinter]] with party
> Sildar seems much more at ease.
> "My friends," he says, "let us secure lodgings. I'm told the local inn is very quaint."

- Sildar's plan is to get some rest at the [[Stonehill Inn]], then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, [[Iarno Albrek]]
- When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]]
