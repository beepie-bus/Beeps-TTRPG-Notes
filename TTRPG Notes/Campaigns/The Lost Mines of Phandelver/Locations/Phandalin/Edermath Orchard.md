> [!question]+ QUEST: Old Owl Trouble
> Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as [[Old Owl Well]]. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who's there and what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there.
