**Carp's Story:**
- Qelline's son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad of ten years
- enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer
- says that he was playing in the woods near [[Tresendar Manor]] when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of "big ugly bandits" came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn't see him, but it was close. Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel or provide them with directions to the location.

> [!question]+ QUEST: Reidoth the Druid
> Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named [[Reidoth]]. If she figures out that the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as [[Cragmaw Castle]] or [[Wave Echo Cave]], she suggests that they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, "since there's not an inch of the land he doesn't know." She tells the characters that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called [[Thundertree]], just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and she provides directions so the characters can easily find the place.
