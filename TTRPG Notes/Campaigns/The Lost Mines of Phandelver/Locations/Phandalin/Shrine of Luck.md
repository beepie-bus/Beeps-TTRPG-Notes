[[Phandalin]]'s only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins.

It is dedicated to [[Tymora]], goddess of luck and good fortune

- in the care of a scholarly acolyte named [[Sister Garaele]]
- Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.

> [!question]+ QUEST: The Banshee's Bargain
> Recently, Garaele's superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted her to persuade a banshee named [[Agatha]] to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair, but the creature did not appear for her.
> 
> Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jeweled silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who flatters Agatha's vanity might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts.
