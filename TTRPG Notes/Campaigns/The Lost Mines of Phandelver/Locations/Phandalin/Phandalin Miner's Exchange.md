- Miner's Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out
- In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area
- There isn't any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.

- The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding [[Phandalin]]. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named [[Halia Thornton]]. 

> [!question]+ QUEST: Halia's Job Offer
> If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians loiter around [[The Sleeping Giant]] tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call Glasstaff, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader's quarters. Halia doesn't reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.
