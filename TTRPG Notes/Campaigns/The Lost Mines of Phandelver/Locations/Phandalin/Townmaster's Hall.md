> The townmaster's hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: "REWARD—Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the orc menace should inquire within." The notice bears the town's seal and an indecipherable signature.

- Phandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as townmaster each year.
- The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept.
- The current townmaster is a male human banker named [[Harbin Wester]]—a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they're "just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really."

The townmaster's hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.

> [!question]+ QUEST: Orc Trouble
> Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of orcs near [[Wyvern Tor]]. He offers **100 gp** to any group that can take care of the problem.

> [!question]+ QUEST: Finding Cragmaw Castle
> After resting at the [[Stonehill Inn]], [[Sildar Hallwinter]] establishes himself at the townmaster's hall. As an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]], his goal is to bring law and order to [[Phandalin]]. As such, he wants to find the lost mine of [[Wave Echo Cave]] and help the [[Rockseeker Brothers]] put it back into production, believing that bringing prosperity to the region will help civilize the town.
> 
> Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a **500 gp** reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or drive off the tribe's chieftain. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the [[Triboar Trail]] for more raiding parties.

> [!question]+ QUEST: Finding Iarno
> After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that [[Iarno Albrek]], a fellow member of the [[Lords' Alliance]], disappeared while exploring the area around [[Tresendar Manor]] about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what's left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes Iarno as "a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties."
> 
> Unknown to Sildar, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the alias Glasstaff to conceal his identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno's fate, Sildar rewards the party with **200 gp** for eliminating the Redbrand threat.
