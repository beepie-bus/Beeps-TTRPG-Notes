> Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.

- This building is owned by the [[Lionshields]],
- but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry
- The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived.

The master of the [[Phandalin]] post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named [[Linene Graywind]]
- She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn't know who is responsible.
- In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see "Adventuring Gear" in the rulebook.)
- Linene has a few scruples, however, and won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town.
- Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid [[The Sleeping Giant]] tap house.
