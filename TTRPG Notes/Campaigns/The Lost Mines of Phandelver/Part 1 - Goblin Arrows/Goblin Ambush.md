>You've been on the ==Triboar Trail== for about ==half a day==. As you come around a bend, you spot ==two dead horses== sprawled about ==fifty feet== ahead of you, ==blocking== the path. Each has ==several black-feathered arrows== sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.


> [!tldr]+ INFO: Inspection
> The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.


==Four goblins are hiding in the woods==, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.

Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised.
* goblins might surprise some or all the characters
* Make a ==Dexterity== (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them
* Roll a d20, add the goblins' Stealth skill modifier (==+6==) to the roll, and compare the result to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores
* Any character whose score is lower than the goblins' check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat.


> [!warning] COMBAT
>  - two of them rush forward and make melee attacks
> - two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks
> - When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.

### Goblin Trail
After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time
- A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest
- A character who succeeds on a ==DC 10== Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.

**Snare:**
- About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare.
- If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is ==12== or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a ==DC 12== Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap.
- If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a ==DC 10== Dexterity saving throw.
- On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground.

**Pitfall:**
- Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged.
- The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it.
- The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is ==15== or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a ==DC 15== Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a ==DC 10== Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
- The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.
