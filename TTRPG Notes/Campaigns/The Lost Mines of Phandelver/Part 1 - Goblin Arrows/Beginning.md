> In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named [[Gundren Rockseeker]] asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of [[Phandalin]], a couple of days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found "something big," and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to [[Barthen's Provisions]], a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named [[Sildar Hallwinter]], claiming he needed to arrive early to "take care of business."

>You've spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail.
>
>You've encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.

- Encourage the players to **introduce their characters** to each other if they haven't done so already.
- Ask the players to think about **how their characters came to know their dwarf patron**, [Gundren Rockseeker](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#gundren%20rockseeker_lmop). Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player's character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great opportunity for the players to contribute to the adventure's backstory.
- Ask the players to give you the **party's marching order** and how their characters are traveling. **Who's in front**, and who's bringing up the rear? If the characters are escorting Gundren's wagonload of supplies, then **one or two characters** need to be **driving the wagon**. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like.
