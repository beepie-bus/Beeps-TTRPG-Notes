![[cragmaw hideout.jpg]]
The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.

The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a ==bugbear named Klarg==, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a ==messenger from Cragmaw Castle== brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.

- **Ceilings**
	- Most of the caves and passages have ==steeply sloping== ceilings that create ==stalactite==-covered vaults rising ==20 to 30 feet above== the floor.
- **Light**
	- Areas 1 and 2 are ==outside==. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.
- **Sound**
	- The ==sound of water in the cave muffles noises== to any creatures that aren't listening carefully. Creatures can make a ==DC 15== Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.
- **Stream
	- The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.


> [!tldr]+ INFO: What the Goblins Know
>  If the characters capture or charm any of the goblins here, the goblins can be persuaded to divulge some useful information:
> 
> About **fifteen goblins** currently dwell in the lair.
> 
> Their leader is a **bugbear named Klarg**. He answers to **King Grol**, **chief of the Cragmaw tribe**, who dwells in **Cragmaw Castle**. (The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It's about twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.)
> 
> Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf [[Gundren Rockseeker]], capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.
> 
> - The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed. The dwarf's human companion is being held in the "eating cave". [[#6. Goblin Den]]

### 1: Cave Mouth
> Following the goblins' trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream.

* goblins in [[#2. Goblin Blind]] are supposed to be keeping watch on this area, but they are not paying attention
* thicket, which provides the goblins with [[three quarter cover]]

### 2. Goblin Blind
> On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area—including a pair of goblins lurking there right now!

* two goblins
- If the goblins notice intruders in [[#1 Cave Mouth]] open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by ==surprise==.
- If the goblins don't notice the adventurers in area 1, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised.
- Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts

- The thickets around the clearing are ==difficult terrain==, but they aren't dangerous—just annoying. They provide [[half cover]] to creatures attacking through them.

### 3. Kennel
> Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where three wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf's chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.

- three wolves
- attack any creature except goblins that move into room
- does not cause noise
- can be calmed with ==DC 15== Wisdom (Animal Handling) check

**Fissue:** A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a ==natural chimney== that climbs ==30 feet== to area 8. At the base of the fissure is rubbish that's been discarded through the opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a ==DC 10== Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes ==1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen==, landing [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb) at the base of the shaft.

**Developments:**
- wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy
- Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves attempt a single ==DC 15== Strength check.
- success, they loosen the rod and the DC drops to ==10==.

### 4. Steep Passage
- dark

> The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.

Characters using light or darkvision to look farther up the passage spot the bridge at [[#5. Overpass]]. 
>In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.

Any character who can see the bridge in area 5 might also notice the goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a ==Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth)== check result.

- goblin notices the characters if they ==carry any light or don't use stealth== as they approach the bridge
- The goblin does not attack
- Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the "Flood!" section of area 5)
- The goblin moves undetected if its ==Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score== of any character who might notice its movements.

**Western Passage**
- This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments
- Treat the area as difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

### 5. Overpass
> The stream passage continues up beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.
> A rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels that are 20 feet above the stream.

- one goblin
- It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth) check.
- If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed.
- If the goblin spots the adventurers, it signals the goblins in [area 7](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#lmop,1,7.%20twin%20pools%20cave,0) to release a flood (see the "Flood!" section), then throws javelins down at the characters.

**Bridge:**
- This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream.
- possible to climb up the cavern walls from the lower passage to the bridge.
- The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful ==DC 15== Strength (Athletics) check to climb.
- The bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of ==5 and 10 hit points==.
- If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses.
- Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a ==DC 10== Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking ==2d6 bludgeoning== damage and landing [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb) (see "Being Prone" in the rulebook). Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety.

**Flood:**
> The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above!

- Any creature within ==10 feet== of the disused passage at [[#4. Steep Passage]] or the steps leading up to [[#3. Kennel]] can attempt a ==DC 10== Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. 
- On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and washed down to [[#1 Cave Mouth]], taking ==1d6 bludgeoning== damage along the way.

### 6. Goblin Den
> This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.

- six goblins
- one is a goblin leader with 12 hp
- The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave.
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] held prisoner in this chamber. He is securely bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and at ==1 hit point==.
- The goblin leader, ==Yeemik==, is second-in-command of the whole hideout. If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. =="Truce, or this human dies!" he shouts==.

Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in area 8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear's head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn't trust the goblin, and he's right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain.

If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies

**Treasure:** Yeemik carries a pouch containing ==three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp==.

### 7. Twin Pools Cave
> This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear.

- Three goblins guard this cave. If the goblin in area 5 spotted the characters and warned the goblins here, they are ready for trouble. The noise of the waterfall means that the creatures in area 8 can't hear any fighting that takes place here, and vice versa.
- Therefore, as soon as a fight breaks out here, one goblin flees to area 8 to warn Klarg.

### 8. Klarg's Cave
> Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder.

- klarg bugbear with mangy pet wolf, ripper
- 2 goblins
- The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person ("Who dares defy Klarg?" or "Klarg will build a throne from your bones, puny ones!")
- the goblins under his command resent his bullying.

**Fire Pit:**
- The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or 1d6 fire damage to any creature that falls [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb) there. A creature can take each type of damage only once per round.

**Supplies:**
- The piles of sacks and crates can provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them.
- Most are marked with the image of a blue lion—the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin.
- Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg (see the "Treasure" section). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest.

**Developments:**
- If Klarg is warned by the goblins in area 7 that the hideout is under attack, he and his wolf hide behind stalagmites while the goblins take cover behind the piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave.
- If Klarg and company are not warned about possible attackers, the characters have a good chance to surprise them. The easiest way for the characters to achieve this is to climb the chimney from area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction.
- If the wolf is killed, the bugbear attempts to climb down the chimney to [area 3](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#lmop,1,3.%20kennel,0) and flee the cave complex.

**Treasure:**
- The captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, "Phandalin"), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.
- In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains ==600 cp, 110 sp, two potions of healing, and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp).== The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.
