![[redbrand hideout.jpg]]

The Redbrands' base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands have since expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding slave pens, workshops, and barracks.

If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the dungeon in [[#1. Cellar]]. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the dungeon by way of [[#8. Crevasse]].

The hideout consists of well-built dungeon chambers with flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.

**Ceilings:** 10ft high

**Doors:**
- made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks.
- - unlocked unless the text states otherwise.
- [[Iarno Albrek]] ([[#12. Glasstaff's Quarters]]) and a bugbear named Mosk ([[#9. Guard Barracks]]) each carry an iron key that can lock or unlock every door in the complex.
- A locked door can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful **DC 10** **Dexterity** check.
- A door can also be broken down with a successful **DC 20 Strength** check.

**Secret Doors:**
- made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls.
- Spotting a secret door from a distance of no more than 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher
- a character who takes the time to search the wall can find the secret door with a successful **DC 10** Wisdom (**Perception**) check.
- Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked.

**Light:** Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, refilled every few hours as needed

> [!tldr]+ INFO: What the Redbrands Know
> If the characters charm or successfully question any of the Redbrands, they can learn the location of their hideout under Tresendar Manor as well as the following useful information:
> 
> The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard known as Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is made of glass.(Only [[Iarno Albrek]] and the [[Black Spider]] know Glasstaff's real name.) Glasstaff's chambers are in the western end of the stronghold (see areas 11 and 12).
> 
> A mysterious figure called the Black Spider has hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown. The Black Spider has sent bugbears to reinforce the Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see [area 9](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#lmop,2,9.%20guard%20barracks,0)).
> 
> The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous "eye monster" (see [area 8](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#lmop,2,8.%20crevasse,0)).
> 
> The Redbrands have a handful of captives in a holding area "near the old crypts," which are guarded by skeletons (see areas 4 and 5).

### 1. Cellar
Any exploration of the manor grounds finds it deserted, but with plenty of tracks leading to a stone staircase just off the empty ruin of a large kitchen. At the bottom of the stairs stands an unlocked door with a cellar beyond.

> The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.

This room appears to be a large storage cellar, exactly the sort of thing one might expect to find beneath an old manor. The Redbrands want to keep their base of operations hidden, so other than the barrels filled with fresh provisions, nothing in this room gives away their presence.

The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Moving barrels around to thoroughly search them is a **noisy activity that attracts the attention** of the Redbrands in area 2.

**Cistern:**
- rectangular reservoir is clean and filled with cold, fresh water
- 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor (so that the bottom of the cistern is 8 feet below the floor)
- Drain pipes from the roof of the old manor above fill the cistern with water.
- A **waterproof satchel** hangs from a submerged rope attached along the south wall of the cistern, about 2 feet below the surface of the water.
- It's not visible from above the water, but can be found with a successful **DC 15** Wisdom (**Perception**) check or automatically by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains some valuable items.

**Secret door:**** SW

If the ruffians fight in this area and two are defeated, the last ruffian might reveal the secret door by fleeing in that direction.

**Treasure (waterproof satchel):**  potion of healing, a potion of invisibility, 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing

### 2. Barracks
This barracks is a good place to lie low after shaking down local miners and fur traders.

> This appears to be a storeroom pressed into service as living quarters. Two double bunks stand against the wall near the door, while barrels and crates fill the southern half of the chamber.

* three redbrand ruffians

**Treasure:** All three Redbrands wear belt pouches holding treasure. The first holds **16 sp and 7 gp**; the second, **12 sp and 5 gp**; and the third, **15 ep** and **two garnets (10 gp each)**. Additionally, three dirty scarlet cloaks hang from the bunks.

### 3. Trapped Hall
>Thick dust covers the flagstones of this somber hallway. The walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and the double doors at the west end of the hall are sheathed in copper plate, now green with age. A relief carving of a mournful angel graces the doors.

### 4. Tresendar Crypts
> Three large stone sarcophagi stand within this dusty crypt, and propped up against each sarcophagus is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail. False columns along the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees. The double doors in the southeast corner are sheathed in tarnished copper plate.

- **3 animated skeletons**
	- attack anyone with 10 feet of doors 5 and 6
	- unless wearing redbrand cloak or speaks password **illefarn**

The stone lid of each sarcophagus is carved to depict the person entombed withinâ€”two human males and one human female, all of noble bearing. If opened, the tombs contain mostly moldering bones and scraps of clothing

An **ornate gold bracelet (90 gp)** lies amid the bones in the sarcophagus containing the female human remains

### 5. Slave Pens
>This long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south. Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks. A pair of disheveled human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north. All are dressed in plain gray tunics and have iron collars fitted around their necks.
>
>A heap of discarded clothing is piled carelessly against the far wall.

Fighting in this room alerts the Redbrands in area 5 that trouble is on the way.

### 8. Crevasse

character who listens at this door with a successful **DC 10** Perception hears several gruff voices issuing demeaning commands in the Goblin tongue. Examples include "Lick the floor!" and "Roll like a dog!" The bugbears here are bullying their goblin slave.

> This barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped-up blankets and dirty dishes scattered about. A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air. Three tall, furry humanoids are lounging among the mess, barking orders at a sad little goblin that demeans itself for their amusement. Your sudden appearance causes the goblin to faint.
