Within a day or so of the adventurers' arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in a number of different ways:

- After speaking with a number of NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house.
- The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter and go straight to "Redbrand Hideout."
- If the characters show no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in street. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.

> [!todo]+ OPTIONAL: Sleeping Giant
> [[The Sleeping Giant]]
> The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.
> 
> One of the thugs spits on the ground. "Well, well," he snarls. "Here's a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come here to bark at us?"

> [!todo]+ OPTIONAL: Street
> As you head back into the street, you see four armed ruffians waiting for you. All of them are humans wearing grimy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they watch you. One of the ruffians spits on the ground.
> 
> "Time for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way."

* four redbrand ruffians
* if most are defeated, last flees

**Developments:**
Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can impart useful information. (See the "What the Redbrands Know" in the link below.) Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]] won't want to keep Redbrand prisoners until he knows the whole gang has been defeated, but the characters can easily persuade or intimidate him into locking up any prisoners they capture for at least a few days.

If the characters kill the ruffians, most members of the town are grateful. One exception is the townmaster, who fears Redbrand retaliation. Harbin doesn't punish the characters but warns them not to cause trouble.
