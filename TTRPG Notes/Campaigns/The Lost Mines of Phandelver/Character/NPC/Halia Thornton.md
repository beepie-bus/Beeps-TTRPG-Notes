[[Phandalin Miner's Exchange]]
- Member of the [[Zhentarim]] with a quest for the party.
- In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant
- She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, 
- Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don't cross her.
- wants to take over the redbrands

> [!todo]+ OPTIONAL: Joining the Zhentarim
> If the party disposes of the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Zhentarim. She speaks with those who share the Zhentarim's pursuits, such as wealth and power. Even if the party wipes out the Redbrand gang, Halia might still extend the offer in an effort to gain friends (and spies) within the party. If a character agrees, Halia gives the individual the title of Fang.
