# Black Stream: Solo Heroes
*by [Kevin Crawford](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/browse?author=%22Kevin+Crawford%22&page=3&sortBy=lowestPrice)*. Published by *[Sin Nomine Publishing](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3482/sine-nomine-publishing)* 

Rules mods that allow you two send just one or two heroes #solo through an adventure. For use with any old-school game including #DnD/5e  and #pf/2e .

#### Perils of Solitude
Common problems with solo RPGs are:

***Hitpoints deplete too quickly.*** A party of six level 1 fiighters has about **6d8** hit points spread among them. Wounded PCs can leave combat. There's more margin of error.

***Enemies don't die quickly enough.*** That same party would do about 6d8 damage to the enemy every round.

***Instant death and incapacitation effects can wipe out lone heroes.*** Spells, poisons, etc. can incapacitate solo adventurers and a single roll. Without teammates, this danger is deadly.

***Lone heroes lack the wide range of skills and abilities of a party.*** 

#### The First Rule: Damage Dice
For a solo hero game, read all dice as such:

> [!infobox|left] Taking Damage
> 
> | Die Result | Damage Done |
> | :--------: | ----------- |
> | 1 or less  | 0 damage    |
> |   4 - 5    | 1 damage    |
> |   6 - 9    | 2 damage    |
> |    10+     | 4 damage    |
> Damage dice table
 ^2ed89a
 
 This is used for all effects that include damage, including fireballs, arrow traps, falls, etc.

If an effect does a flat number of damage, ==divide it by two and round down==.

| Flat Damage | Damage Done |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 - 3       | 0           |
| 4 - 7       | 1           |
| 8 - 11      | 2           |
| 12 - 15     | 3           |
| 16 - 19     | 4           |
#### The Second Rule: Inflicting Damage
Damage done to NPCs counts as *full hit die* for each put. If a fighter hits an orc and rolls 3 damage, that orc loses 3d8.

When fighting enemies of lesser or equal HP, the you can roll for **fray**. This includes punching, kicking, biting etc towards an enemy that doesn't clearly outclass them.  This always does damage.

The fray die is one die of your hit die. Fray is a meta-bonus action.

If enough damage is done to kill an NPC, you can spend the rest of the damage injuring a foe in range, of equal or worse AC.

#### The Third Rule: Healing
The [[#^2ed89a|damage dice table]] is also used for healing.

After every fight, a hero can take five minutes to bandage their cuts and catch their breath. This cures up to **2** points of damage. It doesn't repair any damage suffered from Defying Death.

#### The Fourth Rule: Defying Death
Any time the hero confonts a failed save against a death spell, an assassin, an energy drain, or any other hopeless situation, they may **Defy Death***. This allowed the PC to suffer a ==damage die for every level== they possess.

> [!infobox|left] Defying Death
> 
> | Death | Damage Done |
> | :--------: | ----------- |
> | First  | 1d4   |
> |   Second    | 1d6    |
> |   Third   | 1d8   |
> |    Fourth     | 1d10   |
> Death table
 ^2ed89b

If the damage done would kill them, instead they're left at 1 HP and the doom affects them normally.

#### The Fifth Rule: Experience and Henchmen
One hero earns only a quarter of the normal XP, as usually they're in a party. Henchmen and retainers can be employed as normal. They are treated as monsters for the purpose of combat damage.

### Optional Rules and Guidelines

#### Enduring Protagonists
For some GMs and players, their intention is to play a single character as a hero. They want to explore a story and aren't interested in death or other dooms.

An enduring protagonist always has ==maximum HP== for their class and level. Zero HP doesn't mean dead, just that they are left for dead. However, 'dying' and before forced to retreat means they will fail whatever time-sensitive task they had.

#### Automatic Initiatve
A bad initiative roll can take down the mightiest of warriors. You may simply put the hero at the start.
