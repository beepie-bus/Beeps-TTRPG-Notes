### Concentration

If you’re concentrating on a spell or ability and something happens to threaten your focus, the Dungeon Master can ask you to make a #con ==Constitution saving throw==. If you are successful, you maintain your concentration. If you are unsuccessful, your concentration breaks and the effect ends.
